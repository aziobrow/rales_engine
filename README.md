# Rales Engine

Rales engine (Sales Engine via Rails) is a RESTful Business Intelligence API written in the Rails framework. It returns JSON data for Merchants, Customers, Invoices, Items, and Transactions.  In addition to RESTful show and index pages, there are several BI requests available. Please see below for specific URIs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ruby 2+
Rails 4+
See Gemfile for required gems and their versions

### Installing

To run a Rales Engine from your machine, fork and clone. Navigate to the desired project folder on your machine and clone down your version

From your terminal

```
cd rales engine
```
```
bundle
```
```
rails db:create db:migrate
```

For the CSV data, visit https://github.com/turingschool-examples/sales_engine/tree/master/data.
Download and save to rales_engine/db/csv
Then from your terminal, run this command to seed your database

```
rake import:all
```

Be sure to run
```
rails c
```
...and check that each of the tables have Active Record instances:
```
Merchant.first
Customer.first
Invoice.first
Item.first
Item_invoice.first
Transaction.first
```

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, simply run the rspec terminal command from the root of the project
```
rspec
```
The test suite verifies the functionality of API endpoints for JSON data.


## Deployment

To deploy your very own rales engine, start a server from the project root directory
```
rails s
```
and navigate to localhost3000/api/v1/merchants to get started.

In addition to RESTful show and index pages, there are several BI requests available:
Each table has:
/api/v1/table/find?=      #search by attribute or column name
/api/v1/table/find_all?=  #search by attribute or column name
/api/v1/table/random      #returns a random resource

In addition, API requests can be made using these endpoints:

Relationship Endpoints - Merchants
	GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/items          returns a collection of items associated with that merchant
	GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/invoices       returns a collection of invoices associated with that merchant from their known orders
Relationship Endpoints - Invoices
	GET /api/v1/invoices/:id/transactions    returns a collection of associated transactions
	GET /api/v1/invoices/:id/invoice_items   returns a collection of associated invoice items
	GET /api/v1/invoices/:id/items           returns a collection of associated items
	GET /api/v1/invoices/:id/customer        returns the associated customer
	GET /api/v1/invoices/:id/merchant        returns the associated merchant
Relationship Endpoints - Invoice Items
	GET /api/v1/invoice_items/:id/invoice    returns the associated invoice
	GET /api/v1/invoice_items/:id/item       returns the associated item
Relationship Endpoints - Items
	GET /api/v1/items/:id/invoice_items      returns a collection of associated invoice items
	GET /api/v1/items/:id/merchant           returns the associated merchant
Relationship Endpoints - Transactions
	GET /api/v1/transactions/:id/invoice     returns the associated invoice
Relationship Endpoints - Customers
	GET /api/v1/customers/:id/invoices       returns a collection of associated invoices
	GET /api/v1/customers/:id/transactions   returns a collection of associated transactions

Business Intelligence Endpoints - All Merchants
	GET /api/v1/merchants/most_revenue?quantity=x      
  returns the top x merchants ranked by total revenue
	GET /api/v1/merchants/most_items?quantity=x     
  returns the top x merchants ranked by total number of items sold
	GET /api/v1/merchants/revenue?date=x      
  returns the total revenue for date x across all merchants
Business Intelligence Endpoints - Single Merchant 	
	GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/revenue       
  returns the total revenue for that merchant across successful transactions
	GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/revenue?date=x      
  returns the total revenue for that merchant for a specific invoice date x
	GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/favorite_customer       
  returns the customer who has conducted the most total number of successful transactions.
	BOSS MODE: GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/customers_with_pending_invoices       
  returns a collection of customers which have pending (unpaid) invoices. A pending invoice has no transactions with a result of success. This means all transactions are failed. Postgres has an EXCEPT operator that might be useful. ActiveRecord also has a find_by_sql that might help.
Business Intelligence Endpoints - Items
	GET /api/v1/items/most_revenue?quantity=x       
  returns the top x items ranked by total revenue generated
	GET /api/v1/items/most_items?quantity=x       
  returns the top x item instances ranked by total number sold
	GET /api/v1/items/:id/best_day       
  returns the date with the most sales for the given item using the invoice date. If there are multiple days with equal number of sales, return the most recent day.
Business Intelligence Endpoints - Customers
	GET /api/v1/customers/:id/favorite_merchant       
  returns a merchant where the customer has conducted the most successful transactions
